        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Oin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin.

                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
                company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the
                group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin
                and younger brother of Óin.

                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of
                the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
                March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin
                to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin
                referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling
                distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <p>
                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. 
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
                friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

                He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once
                more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
                younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin
                accompanied Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left
                the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In
                TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood
                from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin
                to inform him the news.

                the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

                Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the
                forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his
                grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be
                the strongest of the thirteen companions.
                to inform him the news.

                and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced
                to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a
                new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

                Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of
                Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown,
                though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of
                the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli
                was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the
                quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the
                loss of Thráin II.
